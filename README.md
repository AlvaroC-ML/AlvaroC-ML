Welcome to my Github! Quick notes here:
-  My name is Alvaro Carbonero. Nice to meet you.
-  I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics, and soon I will have a master's degree in mathematics as well.
-  For the past several months, I've dedicated myself to transitioning from a career in academia as a graph theorist to a career as an ML engineer/researcher. 
-  This fall, I paused my master's degree to do an internship with the Renewable Energy National Lab.
-  For more details about myself, check out my resume here.
