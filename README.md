Welcome to my Github! Quick notes here:
-  My name is Alvaro Carbonero. Nice to meet you!
-  I have a bachelor's degree and master's degree in mathematics.
-  For the last two year, I've been transitioning from a career in academia as a graph theorist to a career in industry/national labs as an ML engineer/researcher for climate change. 
-  I have interned at the National Renewable Energy Lab, and at the MILA Quebec AI Institute. At both internships, I worked on accelerated material discovery through machine learning. I recently started a yearlong fellowship at the Los Alamos National Lab working on climate change related problems. Currently, I am working on underground hydrogen storage simulation.
-  All my ML work, past, current, and (foreseeable) future, has been and will be focused on battling climage change, but I do enjoy ML theory. As I get better, I hope to start posting some projects I do in my free time.

-  Most of my service work was done through an organization I co-founded called OURFA2M2 (a long name with a nice acronym). Learn more about it by clicking [here](https://www.ourfa2m2.org)
