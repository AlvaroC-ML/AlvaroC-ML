Welcome to my Github! Quick notes here:
-  My name is Alvaro Carbonero. Nice to meet you!
-  I have a bachelor's degree and master's degree in mathematics.
-  For the last year, I've been transitioning from a career in academia as a graph theorist to a career in industry/national labs as an ML engineer/researcher. 
-  I have interned at the National Renewable Energy Lab, and I am currently interning at MILA. This August, I will start a yearlong fellowship at the Los Alamos National Lab.
-  All my ML work, past, current, and (foreseeable) future, has been and will be focused on battling climage change, but I do enjoy ML theory. As I get better, I hope to start posting some projects I do in my free time.
-  For more details about myself, check out my (outdated) resume by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GKyqrWBHPQU7Sf_uRP5HMHHB4uiz8t18/view?usp=sharing). If you are curious about my (outdated) math publications and presentations, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tXDdC-g_byfHgqQYyfb7PbTvOGRym3JO/view?usp=sharing). Most of my service work was done through an organization I co-founded called OURFA2M2 (a long name with a nice acronym). Learn more about it by clicking [here](https://www.ourfa2m2.org)
